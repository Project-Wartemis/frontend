<button mat-button color="warn">This game is still under development</button>

<h2>1. Mechanics</h2>

<h3>a. Start</h3>
<p>
  The game is played on a graph. There are a set number of nodes, connected by links.<br>
  Each node is controlled by a <strong>player</strong> (possibly by the neutral player), and each node has an amount of troops on it.<br>
</p>

<h3>b. Deploy</h3>
<p>
  Each player has an amount of troops they get to <strong>deploy</strong>. The default amount is how many nodes you control, but may vary based on game settings.<br>
  You get to <strong>choose</strong> where to deploy them and how many.<br>
  You can <strong>split them up</strong> however you want, and you can even <strong>choose not to</strong> deploy all/any of them.<br>
  You will, however, not be able to save them up and deploy later. <strong>They are lost</strong> if you do not use them.
</p>

<h3>c. Move</h3>
<p>
  Each turn, every player can choose to <strong>send</strong> a specific amount of troops from any controlled node to an adjacent node (directly connected with a link).
</p>

<h3>d. Battle</h3>
<p>
  When opposing armies <strong>meet</strong>, they fight. Each army loses an equal amount of troops until one army remains.<br>
  There are two moment where armies battle:
  1. While traveling to a node
  2. When sieging a node
</p>

<h3>e. Travel battle by example</h3>
<p>
  Player 1 has node A, player 2 has node B, and node A and B are linked.<br>
  Player 1 sends 10 troops from A to B.<br>
  Player 2 send 6 troops from B to A.<br>
  The armies meet on the link between A and B, and 4 troops are left from player 1.<br>
  These 4 troops continue their path to node B.
</p>

<h3>f. Siege battle by example</h3>
<p>
  Players 1,2 and 3 have nodes A,B and C respectively, and they all have 10 troops.<br>
  B is linked to both A and C.<br>
  Player 1 sends 8 troops from A to B.<br>
  Player 2 stands their ground.<br>
  Player 3 sends 4 troops from C to B.<br>
  The resulting siege in node B has the following participants: A(8) - B(10) - C(4)<br>
  The winner is B with 2 troops remaining, and keeps control of their node.
</p>

<h3>g. Winning</h3>
<p>
  The goal is to be the only player remaining with nodes under their control.
</p>

<h2>2. State syntax</h2>

<div>
  In the state your bot receives, the <strong>neutral</strong> player will have id <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>your bot</strong> will have id <strong>1</strong>.<br>
  There is a lot of data included that is <strong>only used for animations</strong>, so don't be intimidated.<br>
  The only things that are relevant to your bot probably are:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>players - to see how many troops everybody gets to deploy</li>
    <li>nodes - to get the structure of the game itself</li>
    <li>links - to get the structure of the game itself</li>
    <li>stages.end - to get the actual latest state</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>a. Typescript structure</h3>
<pre><code class="language-typescript" >{{stateStructure}}</code></pre>

<h3>b. JSON example</h3>
<p>
  Player 1 takes over node 1 with 4 troops sent from node 0.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{{stateExample}}</code></pre>

<h2>3. Action syntax</h2>

<h3>a. Typescript structure</h3>
<pre><code class="language-typescript" >{{actionStructure}}</code></pre>

<h3>b. JSON example</h3>
<p>
  The message sent by player 1 that resulted in the above state
</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{{actionExample}}</code></pre>

<h2>4. Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Deploys happen before moving. You can move troops that are freshly deployed.</li>
  <li>If you have 5 troops on a node, sending 5 troops is allowed, but you will lose control of the node.</li>
</ul>
