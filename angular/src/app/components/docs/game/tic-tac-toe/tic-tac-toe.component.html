<h2>1. Mechanics</h2>

<p>
  The game is played on a 3x3 grid. There are 2 players, X and O.<br>
  Each player gets to place their symbol on a free position on the 3x3 grid.<br>
  Player X starts. The goal is to get 3 in a row (in any row/column or diagonal).<br>
  The game is drawn if the board is full and neither player has 3 in a row.
